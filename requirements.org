This project is to enable people to download a Raspberry Pi script (embedded system with easy updating features) that, when combined with the
physical hardware setup will enable them to make their own track.
Success for this project will be an open source solution to pinewood derby races, and for me to have learned about embedded systems.

|      1 | The system shall include a track that can run pinewood derby cars down its length.                                                                                                   | Physically see the track be used by a pinewood derby car                                                                                           | The track allows standard sized pinewood derby cars down its length                                                                                                                                                                           |
|      2 | The system shall release cars down the track                                                                                                                                         | The cars will be stopped until released by a device on the track                                                                                   | The system will release the cars based on an electronic signal from the embedded system                                                                                                                                                       |

|      4 | The system may handle at least 50 cars. This project will take a hardware setup that when connected to the internet and pointed at the right script will run a pinewood derby track. | Cars shall be used (possibly multiple times if less than 50 cars are available)                                                                    | It shall be shown that the system can record and track 50 cars                                                                                                                                                                                |

|      7 | The system shall handle someone throwing their hand underneath the sensors, a car falling off of the track, etc.                                                                     | Ability to restart an individual race, or throwing the system off by recalculating the finishing time.                                             | The system shall have a means of escaping bad input                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|      8 | The system shall handle ties                                                                                                                                                         | If two competitors times are the same, the system will record ties.                                                                                | The system shows ties as having happened                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|      9 | The system may have a wifi with a server and web interface that allows the system to be run from a smart phone, tablet, or laptop.                                                   | A webpage that people can access that can control everything in the system                                                                         | The system has a sweet webpage that can control everything in the system                                                                                                                                                                      |

|     11 | The system may handle projecting (through the HDMI port) the scores of each of the racers involved                                                                                   | This will be a giant leaderboard that can be shown from the HDMI port                                                                              | When hooked up to a display, there should be a leaderboard for each boy                                                                                                                                                                       |
|     12 | The system may integrate with services like Twitter to declare winners, etc.                                                                                                         | The Raspberry Pi will send out a tweet of the winner when requested that can then be shared on social media                                        | The system can tweet a winner's name using the Twitter API                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The file would include things like fastest track, overall postion, speed table, average speed, fastest car speed, scale miles per hour, etc. |
|     15 | The system may handle a "double elimination" mode                                                                                                                                    | The system will have a bracket system it follows that runs each race in a double elimination rounds                                                | This system would demonstrate double elimination                                                                                                                                                                                              |
