# How-To
---
1. Get a track
This should be simple, I built mine off of http://www.pinewoodpro.com/images/pinewood-derby-track-plan.pdf
I used screws insead of the brads.
Additionally, the gate release mechanism is different.
2. Hook up the displays
I used Adafruit's 7-Segment displays with I2C backpacks:
https://www.adafruit.com/products/878
I used the colors blue, red, and green.
I wired them as shown in thier tutorial and soldered them to be on I2Cs 0x70 (blue), 0x71 (red), and 0x72(green) spots.
These all connect over the same four pins:
Pin 1: Power
Pin 3: Data
Pin 5: Clock
Pin 6: Ground

3. Hook up the IR sensors:
I used Adafruit's 5mm break beam sensors https://www.adafruit.com/products/2168, and wired them like so:
Pin 17: Power
Pin 39: Ground
Pin 11: Blue Input Pin
Pin 13: Red Input Pin
Pin 15: Green Input Pin

4. Hook up gate release:
I used yet another Adafruit product a Lock-style solenoid: https://www.adafruit.com/products/1512
This was flipped so that it would latch the track release from the bottom.
I used this diagram http://playground.arduino.cc/uploads/Learning/solenoid_driver.pdf to wire it using a TIP120 transistor. https://www.adafruit.com/products/976
This was hooked up like so:
Pin 19: Output to solenoid
Pin 34: Ground
12 Volt DC adapter (from a thrift store) was attached to this circuit as seen in the diagram mentioned above.
This also required many feet of wiring which I got from the local Ace hardware stor.

Note: this was later changed to just be two long 32 foot cables that connect at the start of the track. When the gate is released the timer starts.
This was just done on pin 33 and 34 with a resistor. I need a better solenoid that Adafruit one doesn't have the power to release the gate.

5. Install Software
You will need to clone this repo onto a Raspberry Pi running Rasbian.
You will also need to enable your I2C connection under the advanced settings in the commandline raspi-config tool.
Then you will need to run install.sh from this repo.
